This project is focused on plant disease detection using deep learning techniques. It utilizes the MobileNetV2 architecture pre-trained on ImageNet as a feature extractor and then adds custom classification layers for the specific task of plant disease classification. The dataset consists of images of plants affected by various diseases and healthy plants. Data augmentation is applied to increase the diversity of the training data. The model is trained for 10 epochs with a learning rate schedule and checkpoints to improve its performance. The final trained model is evaluated on a test set, and the classification report and confusion matrix provide insights into its performance. Sample images from the test set are also visualized, displaying the actual labels and the model's predicted labels for each image. The project demonstrates an application of deep learning for plant disease identification, which can be helpful in agriculture for the early detection and mitigation of diseases, potentially improving crop yield and overall plant health.
